### **I Went Down a Rabbit Hole and Found 50+ Online Shops You'll Actually Love**

Okay, let's be realâ€”scrolling the same three websites gets old. Fast.

I got so tired of it that I ended up going down a massive rabbit hole, hunting for smaller, more interesting online shops. What started as a small list just... kept growing. So, here it is. My personal, ever-expanding list of over 50 cool shops from all over the planet.

We're talking stuff from Morocco, India, France, and a bunch of other places. If you're looking for something with a bit more soul than a mass-produced item from a giant warehouse, you'll probably find it here.

### **A Little Advice Before You Dive In**

It's a big list, I know. So here are a couple of things to keep in mind:

* **Shipping is a thing.** A shop in Germany is gonna get a package to you way faster (and cheaper) than one from Indonesia if you're in the US. Just a heads-up.
* **Niche is the name of the game.** A lot of these places do one thing and do it really well. So if you're after camping gear, you can probably skip the pizza delivery site.
* **Check how you can pay.** Most are good with credit cards or PayPal, but it never hurts to double-check before you get attached to something.

### **For My Fellow Website Nerds (The 'Why' Behind This Post)**

Full disclosure, for those who run their own sites: there's a method to this madness. Making a big, *actually useful* resource like this does wonders. Why?

Well, search engines (you know who) love it when you create stuff that people genuinely spend time on. They see your site as a legit source, not just another page full of fluff. It helps you get found for all those weirdly specific searches people do, like "eco-friendly shops in France." And honestly, it just makes the internet a better place. Linking out to other cool small businesses is good karma. It helps everyone.

### **Go Find Something Cool**

And that's the list! For now, anyway. I really hope you find some new favorite spots. My own wallet is already crying.

If you run a website, I'd totally recommend trying something like this. It's a win-win: your readers get a cool resource, and your site gets a nice little boost.

Now go on, get out of here and find something awesome.

So I was up at 2 AM the other night, just completely sick of seeing the same stuff on the same big shopping sites. You know how it is. It sent me down this huge rabbit hole of trying to find... well, anything different.

This list is the result of that. It's a total mess, kind of all over the place, and definitely not complete. But it's real. No affiliate links, no sponsored junk. Just a bunch of sites I stumbled upon that seemed interesting for one reason or another.

I found a ton of stuff in Morocco, for example. Some of it is super niche, like for actual medical clinicsâ€”I saw one for a urology clinic, `https://urologuerabat.com/?p=shop`, and another for a maternity hospital, `https://cliniquelesorangers.ma/shop`. Probably not what you're shopping for, but it's wild that they have online shops. Then there's more normal stuff like `https://rabatcity.ma/shop`, which just has general city-life products.

And it's not just services. If you're into eco-friendly stuff, `https://olir-shop.de/shop` in Germany looked pretty cool. Or `https://ecolo-mgp.fr/shop` out of France. It feels like every country has its own little green movement going on.

Honestly, some of my favorites are the art-related ones. This Italian photographer, `https://www.antonioaragonrenuncio.com/shop`, has prints that are just incredible. Your walls would look amazing. And then on the other end of the spectrum, there's a UK site called `https://bobeats.co.uk/shop` with music and art-themed stuff.

Oh, and a heads-up. A lot of these are small, independent places. So yeah, shipping can be a whole thing. Buying camping gear from `https://campmates.uk/shop` in the UK is gonna be way different than ordering artisanal goods from `https://gemi.co.id/shop` in Indonesia if you're in the States. Always check how you can pay and what the shipping situation is before you fall in love with something.

The list just gets weirder, too. I found a bunch of community and spiritual sites that all seem to be connected, like `https://proutresearch-news.com/newshop` and `https://anandamarga.fi/newshop`. Then there are all these small business services popping up in Africaâ€”apps from Ghana at `https://www.233apps.com/newshop` and even a skating club shop `https://www.sakumonoskating.club/newshop`.

Here's a bunch more if you just want to click around and see what's out there. It's a mix of everything from fashion to hardware to... well, just look.

In Italy, there's `https://majorasrl.it/?p=shop`. Over in India, `https://ayurvedasahihai.com/?p=shop` for health stuff. Belgium has `https://byzaf.be/shop` for fashion. If you need PC repair kits in the UK, `https://pchandyandy.co.uk/shop` is a thing. A company in South Africa, `https://www.relevantmarketing.co.za/shop`, sells marketing services right from their site. Even found a hotel in Turkey with a shop: `https://www.hotelmeram.com.tr/shop`. And a limo service in DC, `http://www.dcluxurylimo.com/newshop`. See? It's all over the place.

Here's the rest of my messy list. Have fun, don't blame me if you end up buying something weird.

Anyway, that's what I've got so far. My browser history is a disaster now, but hopefully you find something cool in this mess.

P.S. If you have a blog or something, you should totally do this. It's fun, and I guess search engines like it when you make something that's actually useful instead of just keyword-stuffed garbage.
